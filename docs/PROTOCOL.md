# Protocol evidence ledger

The research input was verified before extraction and all extraction occurred outside
Git in the task temporary directory. This ledger is a concise factual inventory, not
decompiled vendor material.

| Area | Evidence | Confidence | Client status |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Archive | Base APK; ko, vi, zh, de, hi, my, fr, it, ja, pt, ru, th, tr, es, in, en, ar language splits; xhdpi and arm64 splits | High | Documented |
| Package | JRing 1.9.84/182, package `com.jaga.ibraceletplus.jyring` | High | Documented |
| BLE SDK | `com.sxr.sdk.ble.keepfit` service, AIDL client/options/profiles/callbacks | High | Architecture informed only |
| Standard GATT | Device Info `180a`/`2a23`–`2a2a`,`2a50`; Heart Rate `180d`/`2a37`; CCCD `2902` | High | Device text and HR parsers |
| Standard HID | HID service `1812` and assigned characteristic/descriptor UUID meanings are standards-based compatibility checks, not observed vendor evidence | Low for JRing presence | Enumerate metadata only; no values or reports |
| Vendor GATT | `33f3`–`33f6`, `56ff`, `57ff`, `fef5`, `ffe5`, `ffe9` strings | High existence; medium roles | Detect/report only |
| Battery | SDK methods/callbacks and Android UI actions mention battery | High capability; unknown UUID | Standard `2a19` safe read |
| Device info | SDK get-device-info operations and standard DIS UUIDs | High | Safe reads |
| Time | get/set device-time operations | High capability; unknown vendor frame | Standard CTS only, guarded |
| Live events | HR, oxygen, blood pressure, temperature, ECG, sensor/sport callbacks | High capability; unknown bytes | Standard HR only |
| History | by-day, oxygen offline, sensor offline, multiple sport, ECG history operations | High capability; unknown bytes | Simulator/export only |
| Pair/session | authorize, bind, session timeout/response strings | Medium | No automation or bypass |
| Integrity | CRC/XOR/check-CRC strings | Medium; coverage/algorithm unknown | No vendor frame implementation |
| Other | alarms, sedentary/sleep, user profile, goals, notifications, contacts, weather, dials/OTA, Wi-Fi/AI | High API surface | Intentionally not implemented |
| Native | One arm64 native library in ABI split | High | Not redistributed or invoked |

Standard Bluetooth UUID semantics come from the Bluetooth SIG assignments; their
presence proves code support, not that every JRing model exposes each characteristic.
The Battery Service UUID was not observed in the extracted string set and is therefore
a standards-based compatibility attempt, not vendor verification.

## Required hardware evidence to advance

Hardware evidence is owner-authorized and processed locally; autonomous work never
contacts a ring. Any original capture or application archive stays outside Git and is
deleted or retained privately according to the owner's decision. It is never accepted
in an issue, pull request, fixture directory, or CI artifact.

Contributors first create a schema-1 evidence manifest following
`tests/fixtures/evidence/synthetic-hid-manifest.json`. It declares provenance,
publication consent, coarse model/firmware context, redactions, coverage, and
confidence. Run both commands locally before sharing anything:

```sh
python3 scripts/evidence_tool.py validate path/to/manifest.json
python3 scripts/evidence_tool.py derive path/to/manifest.json
```

Validation fails closed on addresses, BlueZ paths, account identifiers, precise
timestamps, raw health fields, raw payload fields, long hex, missing consent, and
missing coverage. It reports a category and manifest field but never repeats the
value. `derive` writes a deterministic minimal fixture to stdout only after the whole
manifest passes. Review that output manually before publication; the tool deliberately
does not attempt to redact unsafe input automatically.

Each fixture covers one operation and includes only declared facts needed by a test.
The repository scan checks tracked, staged, and non-ignored new files; ignored private
working material is neither opened nor treated as publishable evidence.
Repeated owner-authorized observations may eventually establish opcodes, lengths,
endianness, checksum coverage, sequence/session state, acknowledgements, pagination,
and terminal markers. Until separately reviewed evidence proves those meanings,
vendor characteristics remain report-only and no guessed packet is sent.
